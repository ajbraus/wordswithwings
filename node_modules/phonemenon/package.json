A `stress` of 1 indicates that a phoneme has the primary stress and 2 indicates secondary. 0 indicates no stress and -1 indicates a phoneme that does not start a syllable.\n\nWhat do all of these things do?\n===============================\n\nMakefile targets\n----------------\n\n**phoneme-groups-with-syllables.json:** All the phoneme groups derivable from the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict).\n\n**syllable-follower-analysis.json:** A listing of all the syllables and many times other syllables in the corpus follow them.\n\n**phoneme-follow-frequencies.js** A module that all the phonemes and how many times other phonemes follow them in the corpus.\n\nScripts\n-------\n\n**phoneme-syllable-analyze.js**\n\nA script that pipes [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict) text into `syllablize-through`, then pipes that into `syllable-freq-analysis` to get a JSON object that has a key for every possible syllable whose value is an object listing all of the syllables that could follow it, along with the number of times the syllable did follow it. There is a special key called 'START' that lists all the syllables that can start a word.\n\n    cat ../cmudict/cmudict.0.7a | node phoneme-syllable-analyze.js syllable-analysis.json\n\n**phonemize-analyze-ff.js**\n\nA script that converts [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict) text into word/phoneme objects, then analyzes those.\n\n    cat cmudict.0.7a | node phonemize-analyze-ff.js out.js --make-module\n\n**phonemize-console.js**\n\nA script that converts CMU text that's piped in via stdin into stringified JSON objects. Usage example:\n\n    cat cmudict.0.7a | node phonemize-console.js\n\nOutput will be a whole bunch of [phoneme group](#phoneme-group) JSON objects.\n\n**phonemize-file.js**\n\nA script that uses `cmuTextToPhonemeStream.js` to create a line-separated JSON file full of  [phoneme groups](#phoneme-group). Example.\n\n    cat cmudict.0.7a | node phonemize-file.js phonemes.json\n\n**phonemize-syllablize.js**\n\nA script that pipes [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict) lines into `syllablize-through` to get phoneme groups with syllables, then writes those to a file. Example usage:\n\n    cat ../cmudict/cmudict.0.7a | node phonemize-syllablize.js syllable-list.json\n\nOr:\n\n    make syllable-list.json\n\nModules\n-------\n\n**cmu-text-to-phoneme.js**\n\nA stream that converts lines of text from the [CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict), like this –\n\n    EARTHY  ER1 TH IY0\n\n– into [phoneme group](#phoneme-group) objects.\n\n**followerfreq-analysis-stream.js**\n\nA stream that analyzes phoneme groups you write to it, then returns the analysis via the callback when the end is reached. The analysis will be a dictionary with entries for each phoneme and the number of times other phonemes follow it, like so:\n\n    \"EH\": {\n        \"K\": 2950,\n        \"N\": 4860,\n        \"S\": 2451,\n        \"F\": 474,\n        \"R\": 3885,\n        \"M\": 1406,\n        \"TH\": 181,\n        \"L\": 4080,\n        \"T\": 1947,\n        \"D\": 1331,\n        \"G\": 514,\n        \"P\": 633,\n        \"SH\": 331,\n        \"V\": 655,\n        \"JH\": 236,\n        \"B\": 296,\n        \"HH\": 54,\n        \"Z\": 465,\n        \"DH\": 101,\n        \"NG\": 259,\n        \"CH\": 147,\n        \"W\": 16,\n        \"ZH\": 38,\n        \"Y\": 4,\n        \"AH\": 3,\n        \"OW\": 1,\n        \"IY\": 1\n      }\n\n**followfreqs.js**\n\nThe output of a run of phoneme-analyze-ff, saved.\n\n**stringify-through.js**\n\nA stream that converts JSON objects into strings.\n\n**syllablefreq-analysis-stream.js**\n\nA stream that analyzes phoneme groups (that have `syllables` properties) you write to it, then returns the analysis: syllables by frequency and following frequency.\n\n**syllablize-through.js**\n\nCreates streams that adds `syllables` properties to [phoneme groups](#phoneme-group). A phoneme group with `syllables` properties looks like this:\n\n    {\n      \"word\": \"ABDELLA\",\n      \"phonemes\": [\n        {\n          \"phoneme\": \"AE\",\n          \"stress\": 2\n        },\n        {\n          \"phoneme\": \"B\",\n          \"stress\": -1\n        },\n        {\n          \"phoneme\": \"D\",\n          \"stress\": -1\n        },\n        {\n          \"phoneme\": \"EH\",\n          \"stress\": 1\n        },\n        {\n          \"phoneme\": \"L\",\n          \"stress\": -1\n        },\n        {\n          \"phoneme\": \"AH\",\n          \"stress\": 0\n        }\n      ],\n      \"syllables\": [\n        [\n          \"AE\",\n          \"B\"\n        ],\n        [\n          \"D\",\n          \"EH\"\n        ],\n        [\n          \"L\",\n          \"AH\"\n        ]\n      ]\n    }\n\n**typesofphonemes.js**\n\nA module for classifying phonemes into the broad categories \"consonantish\" and \"vowelish\".\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nMIT.\n",
